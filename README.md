# go-openai-telegram-bot
A Telegram bot with integration with OpenAI

## Project Initialisation
I initialise the project with these commands, but you don't need to.

```
go mod init
go get github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai
```

If you clone this project and to build it, you only have to perform:

```
go mod tidy
```

It will pull the dependencies which are used in this project.
